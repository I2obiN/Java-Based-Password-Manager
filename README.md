# PasswordRecoveryTool
Java Password Recovery Tool for Chrome/Firefox/IE.
Over time I might expand this to light OS password cracking. Need to do more research on Firefox and IE cracking first.

I'm not responsible for how you use this tool.

## 19/09/2016

 -- v0.1
   Status:
   jar file will decrypt Chrome passwords and output to text file in working directory

   Goal:
   Firefox next, get the hard one out of the way first I guess

## Steps:

  1. Download as zip, unzip to Desktop or wherever you'd like.
   
  2. Run jdec.jar
   
  3. Open output.txt, enjoy your decrypted password chain(s)
